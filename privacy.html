                <p>Under GDPR, we must have a "lawful basis" for processing your data. We use your information for the following purposes based on the corresponding legal grounds:</p>

                <h3>To Provide Our Service (Based on Contractual Necessity):</h3>
                <p>We process your data to fulfill our contract with you, which is our Terms of Use. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating and maintaining the Service.</li>
                    <li>Logging your trips, calculating your driving score, and identifying driving events.</li>
                    <li>Displaying your trip history and statistics to you.</li>
                    <li>Enabling social features with friends you have approved.</li>

                <h3>With Your Explicit Consent (Based on Consent):</h3>
                <p>We will ask for your consent before:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sending you push notifications.</li>
                    <li>Accessing your device's location and motion activity data (the OS will prompt you for this).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Automated Decision-Making:</h3>
<p>We use automated algorithms to calculate your driving score based on your driving behavior (speed violations, harsh braking, acceleration, etc.). This scoring is used solely to provide you with driving insights and help you improve your driving habits. This automated processing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is not used for any automated decision-making that has legal or similarly significant effects</li>
    <li>Does not result in automated profiling that produces legal effects</li>
    <li>Is based on your explicit consent when you use the Service</li>
    <li>Can be reviewed and corrected by you at any time</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to request human review of any automated decisions by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@drivile.com">support@drivile.com</a>.</p>
