                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Your safety is your own responsibility.</strong> The MYSpeedZ application is an informational tool and driving aid; it is not a safety device.
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Substitute for Safe Driving:</strong> The Service is not a substitute for your full attention, judgment, and adherence to safe driving practices. The single most important factor for driving safety is an attentive driver. Always pay full attention to the road and obey all traffic laws and regulations.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Data Accuracy Not Guaranteed:</strong> Information provided by the Service, including but not limited to speed limits, stop sign locations, road conditions, and driving analysis, is sourced from third-party providers and is provided "as is." This data may be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated. Do not rely solely on the Service for driving decisions. You are solely responsible for the safe operation of your vehicle.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Hands-Free Operation:</strong> It is dangerous and illegal in many places to interact with a mobile device while driving. You agree to use the Service in a safe and legal manner, including using hands-free features like Siri where available and appropriate.</li>

                    <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> All subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel them at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Free Trials:</strong> We may, at our sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period. If you do not cancel before the end of the free trial, you will be automatically charged the subscription price.</li>
