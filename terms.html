                <h2>5A. Location Access and Permissions</h2>
                
                <p>Drivile relies on location services and motion activity to provide core functionality such as auto-trip detection, trip logging, speed monitoring, and navigation-related features. We follow platform guidelines and respect your choices. The following explains when and why we access these signals:</p>
                
                <h3>Foreground Usage (When App Is Open)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When In Use Access:</strong> While the app is in the foreground, we access your location to display your current position, render maps, show speed and speed limits, and enable navigation-related capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Continuous Background Requirement:</strong> Foreground usage does not imply background tracking. If you close/minimize the app and have not enabled auto-trip tracking, continuous location updates stop.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Background Usage (When App Is Closed or In Background)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conditional Background Tracking:</strong> Background location access occurs only when <em>Auto Trip Tracking</em> is enabled and motion activity indicates that you are driving, or when a manual trip is actively in progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Motion-Gated:</strong> We use motion signals (e.g., automotive vs. stationary) to start/stop background tracking. If you are stationary, background tracking is paused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trip Boundaries:</strong> Background tracking stops automatically when the trip ends (detected via motion/activity signals or when you manually end a trip).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Motion & Fitness Permissions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Motion activity (e.g., automotive vs. stationary) helps detect when to start/stop auto trips without requiring constant location polling.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can disable motion access in system settings. If disabled, auto-trip detection may not function as intended.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>User Controls and Transparency</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Toggles in App:</strong> You can enable/disable <em>Auto Trip Tracking</em>, <em>Sound Alerts</em>, <em>Friend Alerts</em>, <em>Use Google Maps UI</em>, and other features. Changes take effect in real time.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Settings:</strong> You can change Location (Never / Ask Next Time / While Using / Always) and Motion & Fitness permissions at any time in iOS Settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Granular Logging:</strong> The app logs toggle changes and subscription context to improve user support and transparency (no sale of personal data).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Data Handling, Retention, and Deletion</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trip Data:</strong> Trip start/end, route traces, speeds, and aggregate metrics are stored to power analytics and history views.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain data for as long as your account remains active or as needed to provide the Service, unless you request deletion earlier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your account and associated data through support. Deletion removes historical trip and related personal data from active systems, subject to backup and legal requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Consent and Revocation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> By enabling location permissions and app toggles, you consent to the described access patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> You can revoke permissions in iOS Settings at any time. Certain features may degrade or stop working when permissions are revoked.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Location Tracking Scenarios</h3>
                <div class="info-box">
